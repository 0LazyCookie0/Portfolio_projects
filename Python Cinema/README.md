# Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and correlation analysis are essential techniques in data science that provide valuable insights into datasets and uncover meaningful relationships between variables. In the context of the film industry, analysing movie data using these techniques can offer valuable information about various aspects of the movies, such as their genres, production companies, budgets, revenues, ratings, and user engagement.

In this project, I conducted an EDA and correlation analysis on a comprehensive movies dataset using Python. My aim was to explore the dataset, understand its structure, and uncover patterns and relationships within the data. By performing this analysis, I aimed to gain insights that could be utilised to inform decision-making, budget allocation, marketing strategies, and overall understanding of audience preferences in the film industry.

# Correlation Analysis Result

1. Gross earning and Budget are highly correlated.
2. Votes and gross earning are also correlated.

# Feature Engineering Result

During this part of the EDA I found out the profit made by each movie.

It was discovered that **1744** were in loss which is about **32%** of the total movies that we analysed.
